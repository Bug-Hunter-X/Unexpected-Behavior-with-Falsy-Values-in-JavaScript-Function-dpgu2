# JavaScript Falsy Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript where falsy values (other than null) are not explicitly handled in a function that expects numbers.

The `bug.js` file contains the function with the bug. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that handles falsy values more robustly.

## Bug Description

The original function correctly handles `null` values, but it doesn't explicitly check for other falsy values like `0`, `false`, or an empty string.  This can lead to unexpected results or runtime errors, especially if the function is used with data that might contain these falsy values.

## Solution

The solution introduces more comprehensive checks using `typeof` to verify the input values are numbers or handle them appropriately if they are not.
